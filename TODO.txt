 - finish hardcoding default configs for affixes (check AttributeAffixes)
 - re-add cleave affix (new AffixConfig type? IntFloatAffixConfig or sth? make numTargets and chance separate values to generate/upgrade)
 - re-add DrawSpeedAffix affix (extend AttributeAffix, move calculations to right place)
 - types predicate to be configured via config file instead hardcoded
    (maybe make use of ItemTags somehow? care not to break compat with mods that add weapons
     that do not extend SwordItem/AxeItem classes but still pretend to be such)
 - prefix/suffix name variants for all affixes so we can get rid of hardcoded 'isPrefix' and have neat item names
 - discrete float values for affixes
    either make DrawSpeedAffix and similar use step-based values or implement config with valuesSet
    over-the-top solution would be to have expression parser and create math functions from config, dont think its worth time though

--------------------------

Review anvil level math at higher levels, as well as repair costs.

Add additional tomes to account for new enchantment types, and clarify usage in tooltips.

Advancements for Fletching

Glass break faster with pickaxe

Experience Storage System with level precision

---Suggestions---

 Some sort of item to directly upgrade 1 enchantment by 1 level. 
 Maybe a sort of legendary tome that can be enchanted or combined with
 books in order to make a sort of "tier up" for a certain enchant. 
 Would be nice for maxing out items via slow and steady progress rather than chance.
 
 a "payload" enchantment for crossbows that increases the damage of firework rockets?
 
 
 some changes to lapis, because it piles up really fast and you never
 actually have to worry about running out of it (configurable "fuel"
 for ench table or something else optional to make the ench process in general more end-gamish) 
 or rare temporary buffs to new table stats
 
 trident had a damage increasing enchant. One that wasn't specific to certain mobs 
 
 Allow enchantment name color to be changed as part of enchantments.cfg
